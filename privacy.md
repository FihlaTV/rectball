## Permissions

Let's face it. I hate apps that request too many permissions as much as you
hate. That is why I try to make my apps to use only the permissions that are
actually required to make the game run.

Rectball requires the following permissions even in the Open Source version.
Of course, you can disable these permissions by removing that code while
compiling Rectball from source:

* **Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage** (Storage, Media):
  When you share a screenshot of your score, I temporally have to save this
  screenshot on your device before I can prompt you how to share the photo.
* **Read the contents of your USB storage** (Storage, Media): this permission
  is also used to share screenshots.

The following permissions are only used by the Rectball version that is
available through the Google Play Store. This is: they are used by some third
party source code that is not available on the Open Source version. If you
are compiling from source because you don't trust Google Play Store or me,
you won't use these:

* View network connections.
* Full network access.
* Prevent device from sleeping.

These permissions are used by the Google Play Services integration code that
is used to connect the game to Google Play Games so that you can share your
high scores and achievements with your friends and other people, and with the
Google Analytics service, whose purpose is explained below.

## Google Analytics and data collection

The Google Play version of this game makes use of Google Analytics for analytic
purposes. Google Analytics is a third party service that collects information
in behalf of Google. You can read their full privacy policy [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

Please understand that personal information is never collected. I only get to
see aggregated data about usage of the game. What information do I use Google
Analytics for?

* To know how many people play Rectball over time.
* How much time people actually spend playing Rectball.
* To get information on the devices running Rectball such as the phone model,
  or the Android version that it is using.
* Whenever something crashes, I get an error log so that I can fix it later.
* How many times does the people play Rectball over time.
* How many points are made over time, in order to tweak the maths if I see
  that the game is too easy or too complicated to play.
* How does the people play the game, e.g., with sound disabled.
* How many people actually follow the tutorial, to see if it is actually
  that useful.
* How many people actually shares scores.

That's all I'm interested in. To sum it up, I use information about how players
use my game in order to improove it and make it better. And of course in order
to fix bugs which is usually a sad thing to find.
