Rectball is a colorful puzzle game for Android. Make selections, clear rectangles and make points before the time runs out. Rectball is open source and runs on Android 2.3+.

## Flavors

This project has two flavors: OSP (Open Source) and GPE (Google Play).

GPE is linked against non-free SDKs such as Firebase and Google Play Services SDK. This is the default version that you get from the Play Store and the one that has achievements, leaderboards and such.

However, GPE requires API keys for those services so you won't probably be able to build those versions. In fact I don't expect you to be able to, because those files are stripped from the repository and can only be downloaded from the Developer Console using my Google Account credentials.

So, yeah. If you want to build the project from sources, you'll have to use the Open Source version. This one is 100% free and only depends on the libGDX framework.
